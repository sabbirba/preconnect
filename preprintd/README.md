## `preprintd`

Printer swarm-worker daemon implementation for [PreConnect](https://github.com/sabbirba/preconnect).

### Overview

This tiny worker is just a `TcpStream` under the hood, constantly listening for jobs and claiming one if open. It works by constantly listening for incoming data from the `api.preconnect.app` endpoint (which uses [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks) under the hood for streaming real-time data), and then initiating the claiming procedure.

### Compiling

Requires [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) (2024 edition or later) to be installed.

To compile and run:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/preprintd --key WORKERKEYHERE
```

> [!NOTE]
> The release binary is optimized for the smallest-possible size, although you can change this behavior by disabling the optimizations specified in the `[profile.release]` section of [Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml).

For running the binary in debug mode, use the `--debug` flag:

```bash
cargo run -- --debug --key WORKERKEYHERE
```

### Prebuilt Binaries

See the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hitblast/preprintd/releases) for a prebuilt binary for either Windows, Linux (built via CI workers running Ubuntu), or macOS.
